"text": "I finally got to check out Alessandroâ€™s Brilliant Pizza and it is now one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. The dining room has a beautiful view over the Puget Sound but it was surprisingly not crowded. I ordered the fried castelvetrano olives, a spicy Neapolitan-style pizza and a gnocchi dish. The olives were absolutely decadent, and the pizza came with a smoked mozzarella, which was delicious. The gnocchi was fresh and wonderful. The waitstaff were attentive, and overall the experience was lovely. I hope to return soon ",
